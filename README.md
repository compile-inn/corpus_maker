# Corpus Maker
This short script takes a text file and returns a list of its words stored in JSON format (txt file -> list JSON). The list is built by excluding spaces and punctuations, and by only keeping workds of minimal length of your choosing.

## My God, what is this for?
Preprocessing for the hearsay generator I am adding to my personal website. Typically, a vocabulary rich or unsual book would be feed to the script. I always like to put King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. My gratitude goes to the GutenbergProject people.

## What next?
Since all this is to have a little fun, I might add some other features such as word counting, longest word, most used word, on so on. Just some ridiculous analytics to parse an author's artistic vision of the world.
